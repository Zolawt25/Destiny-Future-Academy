      <p className="font-semibold text-gray-200 pr-96">Perhaps you’ve heard this important lesson from the philosopher Maimonides before. The main message here is that you can do something for someone and it will be of help at the time, but if you don’t teach them how to do it themselves, they will forever be dependent. That’s one of the most beautiful things about teaching and education– once you share knowledge or obtain knowledge, there is power and capability gained forever.</p>
